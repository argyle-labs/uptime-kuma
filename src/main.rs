//! Dynamic (subprocess) entrypoint for the uptime-kuma plugin.

//! The toolkit's `serve_service_plugin!` emits `fn main`, serving this plugin over the orca
//! socket. Dynamic replacement for the retired cdylib export — the plugin is a
//! `[[bin]]`, owns no runtime, and reaches orca only through the socket.
